React Components:

the developers used to write more than thousand of lines of code to develop a single-page application.

these applications follow the structure of traditional DOM, and it was very challenging to make any change with them.

And if any mistake found, it requires being search manually in the entire application and update accordingly.

The component-based appraoch is introduced to resolve this issue.

According to this approach, the complete application is divided into a small group of code, which is known as components.

a component is considered as the core building block of a React application.

IT makes the  task of building User Interface's Convenient.

Every compoenet resides in the same space, but works independently from one another and merges all them in a parent component, which will be the final User Interface of the application.

Every React component has its structure , methods as well as APIs.
they can be reused as per the requirements.
there are two types of components in ReactJS that are as follows:

--> Functional Components (Stateless Components). only include render method, dont have their own state.
--> Class Components (Stateful component). they can hold local state , but morre complex.

#it requires you to extend from React .
#the class can be created by defining a class that extends the component and has a render function. you can pass data from one class to another class component.
